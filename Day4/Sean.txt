Sean by Shel Silverstein

Sean loves me,

Sean cares,

Sean picks me peaches and pears.

Sean offers me candy and Cokes,

Sean listens and laughs at me jokes.

Sean helps when I get in a fight,

Sean does all my homework at night.

Sean misses me,

Sean cries,

Sean thinks I'm a wonderful guy.

I'll stand up and tell you that Sean is.

I woke up and Sean just wasn't there.

I called out and reached out for Sean's hand,

In the darkness where Sean usually stands.

Sean's gone!
